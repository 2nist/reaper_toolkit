# Console Logger Loading Order Fix

## Problem
```
main.lua:90: attempt to call a nil value (field 'info')
```

## Root Cause
The `console_logger` module was being assigned to `_G.console_logger` before it was actually loaded with `require`. This caused `console_logger.info()` calls to fail because `console_logger` was still `nil`.

**Original problematic order:**
```lua
-- Line 69-70: Global assignment BEFORE require
_G.console_logger = console_logger  -- console_logger is nil here!

-- Line 74: Require happens AFTER global assignment  
local console_logger = require 'console_logger'

-- Line 90: Usage fails because console_logger was nil when assigned to global
console_logger.info("Using EnviREAment ImGui context with name parameter")
```

## Solution
Moved the `require` statements **before** the global assignments to ensure modules are loaded before being used.

**Fixed order:**
```lua
-- Load core modules FIRST
local script_manager = require 'script_manager'
local console_logger = require 'console_logger'
local theming_panel = require 'enhanced_theming_panel'

-- Make them available globally AFTER loading
_G.ImGui = ImGui
_G.console_logger = console_logger
```

## Verification
âœ… **Tests Pass**: Created comprehensive tests that verify:
- Modules are required before global assignment
- `console_logger.info` calls work correctly
- Loading order prevents usage-before-require issues
- Context creation with logging works in simulated REAPER environment

## Files Modified
- **`main.lua`**: Fixed loading order by moving require statements before global assignments

## Test Files Created  
- **`tests/test_console_logger_loading_fix.lua`**: Verifies loading order in main.lua
- **`tests/test_main_console_logger_fix.lua`**: Tests fix in simulated REAPER environment

## Result
ðŸŽ‰ **FIXED**: The `main.lua:90: attempt to call a nil value (field 'info')` error is resolved. The DevToolbox will now load correctly in REAPER without console logger errors.
