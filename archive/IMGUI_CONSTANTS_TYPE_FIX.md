# ImGui Constants Type Fix

## Problem
```
/Users/Matthew/devtoolbox-reaper-master/main.lua:109: bad argument #2 to 'PushStyleColor' (number expected, got function)
```

## Root Cause
The ImGui constants were not being properly validated as numbers. In some REAPER environments, `reaper.ImGui_Col_Text` and other constants might be functions instead of numbers. When these got assigned to `ImGui.Col_Text`, they remained functions, causing `PushStyleColor` to receive a function instead of the expected numeric color index.

**The problematic code pattern:**
```lua
-- This could assign a function instead of a number!
ImGui.Col_Text = reaper.ImGui_Col_Text or 0
```

**When used in PushStyleColor:**
```lua
ImGui.PushStyleColor(ctx, ImGui.Col_Text, 0xFF00FFFF)
--                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ This was a function!
```

## Solution Applied

### **Added Type Checking for Constants**
Modified the constant assignment logic to verify that REAPER constants are numbers before using them:

```lua
-- OLD (could assign functions):
ImGui.Col_Text = reaper.ImGui_Col_Text or 0

-- NEW (ensures numbers only):  
ImGui.Col_Text = type(reaper.ImGui_Col_Text) == "number" and reaper.ImGui_Col_Text or 0
```

### **Added Missing Color Constants**
Extended the fix to include all color constants used in the code:

```lua
-- Added proper type checking for all constants
ImGui.Col_Text = type(reaper.ImGui_Col_Text) == "number" and reaper.ImGui_Col_Text or 0
ImGui.Col_WindowBg = type(reaper.ImGui_Col_WindowBg) == "number" and reaper.ImGui_Col_WindowBg or 2  
ImGui.Col_Button = type(reaper.ImGui_Col_Button) == "number" and reaper.ImGui_Col_Button or 21
```

## Benefits

### âœ… **Type Safety**
- All ImGui constants are guaranteed to be numbers
- `PushStyleColor` calls work correctly 
- No more "number expected, got function" errors

### âœ… **Environment Compatibility**
- Works correctly in EnviREAment setups where constants might be functions
- Works correctly in standard ReaImGui setups where constants are numbers
- Provides sensible fallback values

### âœ… **Code Reliability**  
- Prevents runtime type errors in ImGui calls
- Makes the DevToolbox more robust across different REAPER setups
- Ensures consistent behavior regardless of environment

## Files Modified
- **`main.lua`**: Added type checking for ImGui constants

## Test Coverage
- **`tests/test_imgui_constants_type_fix.lua`**: Comprehensive testing of constant types

## Verification
âœ… **Tests Pass**: Type checking verified for both EnviREAment and standard modes
- All constants are numbers, not functions
- `PushStyleColor` calls work without type errors
- Both environment modes handle constants correctly

## Result
ðŸŽ‰ **FIXED**: The `bad argument #2 to 'PushStyleColor' (number expected, got function)` error is resolved.

The DevToolbox will now:
- Handle ImGui constants correctly in all REAPER environments
- Execute `PushStyleColor` calls without type errors
- Provide consistent styling and theming functionality
- Work reliably across different ReaImGui setups
