# Font Loading Fix Instructions

## Problem
Fonts are not loading because no font preferences have been saved yet.

## Solution
1. **In the DevToolbox GUI:**
   - Select the "enhanced_theming_panel" from the UI Panels list
   - Go to the "Font Configuration" section
   - Click on any font you want to use (e.g., Helvetica, Dymo, etc.)
   - The selection will now auto-save immediately
   - You'll see console messages confirming the save

2. **Restart the script:**
   - Close the DevToolbox
   - Restart the script in REAPER
   - Your selected font should now load

## What was fixed:
- âœ… Font preferences now auto-save when you click radio buttons
- âœ… Added deferred font loading (waits a few frames before trying to attach)
- âœ… Better error handling and logging
- âœ… Clear instructions and file path info in the UI
- âœ… Improved system font handling

## Debugging:
If fonts still don't work, check the console log for:
- "âœ… Font changed to: [font name]"
- "ðŸ’¾ Auto-saved font preference" 
- "âœ“ Deferred font loaded: [font name]"

The theme file should be created at:
`[REAPER Resource Path]/devtoolbox_theme.txt`

## Technical changes:
- Font loading is now deferred until after ImGui stabilizes (3+ frames)
- Font preferences are saved immediately on selection
- Better path resolution for custom fonts like Dymo.ttf
- More robust error handling for missing fonts
